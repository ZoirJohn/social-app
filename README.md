## 📂 Process

1. 🚀 Created with React and TypeScript on frontend, Node.js backend  
2. 🛠 Implemented modular components and Redux slices  
3. 🗄 Designed MongoDB schema for users, posts, messages  
4. 🔄 Set up RESTful APIs with authentication and authorization  
5. ⚙️ Added real-time updates via polling or websockets (if used)  
6. 🌐 Prepared for deployment with environment config and build scripts

## 🔍 How It Works

- **User flow:** Signup/login → create profile → add friends → post content → chat and engage  
- **State:** Redux Toolkit manages frontend state for user sessions, posts, notifications  
- **Backend:** Express routes handle authentication, data persistence, and business logic  
- **Database:** MongoDB stores user data, posts, messages, and relationships  
- **Security:** Passwords hashed with bcrypt, JWT tokens secure sessions

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved

- 🧪 Add unit and integration tests (Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest)  
- 📡 Implement real-time updates with WebSocket or Socket.io  
- 📈 Enhance SEO and accessibility compliance  
- 🤖 Add CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment  
- ♿ Improve UI accessibility and keyboard navigation  
- 🛡 Implement rate limiting and advanced security practices

## 🐞 Issues

- ⚠️ Some API endpoints may lack detailed validation  
- 🖼 Media upload size limits need refinement  
- 🔑 Environment variables required for JWT secrets and DB connections
